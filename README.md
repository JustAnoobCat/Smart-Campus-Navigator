## 🔍 How It Works

1. The map is based on the **Graphic Era Hill University** campus layout. All locations and coordinates were manually mapped by the team for accurate navigation.
2. User selects a source and destination on the campus map.
3. The app sends these coordinates to the Java backend.
4. Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path.
5. The path is shown in both **text** and **visual format** on the map.
