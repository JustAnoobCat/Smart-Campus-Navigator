# 🧭 Smart Campus Navigator

A Java-based web application that helps users navigate efficiently through the university campus by providing the shortest path between locations. Designed to assist students, faculty, and visitors in locating classrooms, labs, offices, and facilities.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗺️ Interactive campus map
- 📍 Click-to-select source and destination
- 📏 Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- 🧑‍🎓 Real campus locations and coordinates mapped manually
- 🎨 Clean and intuitive HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- ☕ Java backend logic for navigation computation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Java
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Tooling:** VS Code, JDK, Apache Server (optional)

## 📸 Screenshots

> _You can add screenshots here of the map UI, shortest path demo, etc._

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User selects a source and destination on the campus map.
2. The app sends these coordinates to the Java backend.
3. Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path.
4. The path is highlighted visually on the map.
